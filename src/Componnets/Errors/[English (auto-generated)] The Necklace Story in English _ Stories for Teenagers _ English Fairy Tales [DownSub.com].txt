once upon a time in the beautiful

country of france there lived a gorgeous

woman by the name of matilda

she always cared about her looks and

worried about not having pretty things

being married to a humble clerk victor

who worked in the ministry of education

and earned a decent salary she bore her

worries with effort

[Music]

that lady's dressed superbly such lovely

ribbons and jewelry and me not even a

bow

why do you worry about such silly things

you are superbly pretty isn't that

enough

matilda wasn't convinced she believed

that she was all deserving of the riches

other women wore

at night victor and she sat together to

dine

ah

warm soup and freshly baked bread isn't

this lovely

uh just old soup and normal bread i wish

we could have eaten a larger course in

fancier silverware

and so matilda lived her days always

wanting more instead of appreciating

what she already had

one day her husband came home in bright

spirits

matilda here's something for you

she tore open the envelope and saw the

invitation inside

this is

an invitation to a ball to be held in a

week's time at the minister's hall isn't

that splendid

splendid victor tell me what do i wear

to that ball huh

oh maybe the dress you wear to the

theater i mean you look lovely to to me

oh what's wrong i

i don't have any anything worth wearing

to such a ball

sweetheart don't cry

how much would a new dress cost

matilda dried her tears and pondered

carefully

about 400 francs

victor turned pale at this

he was saving exactly that much to buy

himself a fishing set to go out with his

work colleagues

very well my love

i will give you the money to get

yourself a very pretty dress

but as the ball came closer matilda

started to get anxious

what's wrong

aren't you satisfied with the dress it's

beautiful but i have no jewelry to go

with it

well i have no money to buy jewelry what

about wearing some flowers that's in

style right now currently

flowers ah then everyone will know the

poverty we live in no i need jewelry or

i won't go

then why don't you ask your friend

gene i'm sure she'll be generous matilda

was delighted at this idea she went to

visit jean who had been a good friend to

her but as gene now had a rich house and

good life matilda had distanced herself

matilda

how have you been

they spoke for quite some time until

matilda finally asked gene for the favor

jewelry well of course i have many

choose whichever you like

she handed jean a box full of many

trinkets and necklaces

the sparkle they held was reflected on

matilda's face

she tried on many but liked none do you

have anything else

how about these two boxes

matilda looked but found nothing in the

first box

but when she opened the second one in it

lay the most beautiful set of diamonds

matilda had ever seen

she carefully lifted them onto her neck

and was delighted at her reflection what

would it be fine if if i could have just

just this

oh of course

matilda was elated thanked jean and

hurried on home

on the night of the ball matilda was a

complete success

she laughed and chatted with much joy so

much so that even the minister himself

greeted her during the evening

once the ball had ended she went to find

her husband who had retired into a room

to rest

he picked up her modest wraps to cover

her shoulders with

ah

these wraps completely ruined the look

of my dress i think i'll do without them

poor victor followed his wife into the

street

that night seemed to be an unlucky one

as no cab seemed available

they walked for a long time until they

finally hailed one

it took them back to their flat and they

tumbled out and up to their room

when they reached inside matilda went to

admire herself one last time

oh no

what happened

the necklace it's not here i've i've

lost it

what

that's impossible

did you wear it before leaving of course

i did i also remember feeling it while

talking to the minister oh what about

the cab

did you get its number i i did not

victor was crestfallen it was already

four o'clock in the morning

oh fine i'll go back the way we came and

searched the streets in case we dropped

it

and so he left leaving matilda alone as

she sat there completely blank

after some hours victor returned sadly

as he had found nothing he told his wife

to write to gene

tell her you have been given the

necklace to be fixed as you've broken

the clasp it will give us time to find

the necklace

and so while matilda did this victor

went and made a complaint to the police

and cab drivers

but no word came to them

we have nothing left to do but replace

the necklace

they went around everywhere looking at

all the jewelers

at last they found a similar necklace as

the one they'd

lost that's it

sir how much is it

and this man made will cost 40 000

francs

painstakingly they agreed to buy it

they begged the jeweler to hold it for

them until they got the money

victor went around begging and asking

around from all his friends and family

he soon collected the amount and they

bought the necklace

she returned it back to jean

who took it back without even looking at

it

thereafter the couple's lives changed

they sent away their helpers and went to

live in a flat which had lower rent

matilda scrubbed and washed and worked

for many houses in the city

her face turned wrinkled and her hands

rough

victor worked for longer hours during

the day and took the night shift too

after 10 whole years of slogging they

had finally paid off their debt

but how changed they both were

how terrible my hands look now

than my beautiful hair it has streaks of

gray in it

think of them as streaks of silver deer

for the hard work we've done

she smiled at him warmly but still felt

sad at what a single string of diamonds

had done to them

one day as she was out walking she saw a

little boy bounding along with a lovely

lady

it's jane and she still looks as lovely

as a rose

should i go and speak to her

gene

hello you do look lovely after all these

years my

dear who is that woman i have never seen

her

madam i'm sorry but i don't think i've

ever

my dear friend it's me matilda

i suppose i have changed a lot

but tilda

but my dear

what happened to you

matilda now told gene everything

she thought that since she'd paid the

whole debt and cleared everything it was

fine to come clean

you

you say you lost my necklace and then

bought a replacement worth forty

thousand francs

yes i'm sorry to have lost it in the

first place

oh

matilda

why didn't you tell me the truth sooner

that necklace wasn't even worth 200

francs

how is that possible

it was exquisitely beautiful

but it was a fake

it was a necklace made out of plain cut

colored glass

and thus poor matilda had learned her

lesson

if she had only been content with what

she had and had counted her blessings

then maybe she wouldn't have gone

through so much trouble

how foolish i have been i had such a

decent house with a loving husband why

didn't i see that earlier

my dear matilda

i'm home what's for lunch oh and i

bought you these flowers

i hope you like them

they're lovely

for lunch i thought we'd have warm soup

and some fresh bread

is that fine

that would be lovely

[Music]
